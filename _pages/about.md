I am the academic coordinator of the HBS doctoral programme "New Challenges in Ageing Societies". I research and teach in the field of health and life course sociology, including the following questions: How does social inequality affect health and quality of life? How do illness and health restrictions influence social participation opportunities over the life course? What challenges does this pose in times of demographic change and what socio-political options are there to actively counteract health inequalities?
